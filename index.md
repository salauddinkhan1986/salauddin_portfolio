# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/salauddinkhan1986/Linear-regression-project/blob/master/Linear_Regression_.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skilled Used**: Python.Pandas and sklearn

**Project Objective**: Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable Result:** We could predict the rental bike count resulting in 78% Accuracy.
- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

*Skilled Used**: Python.Pandas and sklearn

**Project Objective**: The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

**Quantifiable Result:** We could predict the term deposit count resulting in 90% Accuracy.
- Used Logistic Regression to predict the number of peaople term deposit in the a Portuguese bank.
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple logistic regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](/sample_page)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
